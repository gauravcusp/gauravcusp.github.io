                                  <h3><em><b>Location Optimization for Homeless Shelters</b></em><br></h3>
                          The motivation behind this project was the Mayor's aim to come up with 90 new homeless shelters across the city
                                  and closing down the cluster homes and tertiary shleters. We made use of NYC open data portal and scarped some
                                  data from webpages that wasn't available in tabular format. We considered some of the most important variables for our
                                  model like proximity to transit system, distance from schools etc. We ran spatial analysis based on these variables and
                                  assigned score to each zip code in New York City depending on the weight of individual variables. The final result was
                                  a map that suggests which zip code would be most optimum for a new homeless shelter.

                          Through this project, we wanted to understand how AirBnB could affect the property market in New York City. Since there's
                        always a debate in communities if having AirBnB in their neighborhood or not, we considered some important factors in determinig
                        the correlation between the housing prices and and AirBnB listing numbers. We used data from DOF Annualized Rolling Sales, Inside Airbnb and
                        PLUTO to create our model. Since the effect of listing cannot be constrained to a known region, we did buffer analysis
                        on the airbnb listings go get some meaningful insights. The paper that we submitted for our project can be accessed through this <a href="https://github.com/gauravcusp/Papers/blob/master/Effect_of_AriBnB_on_Property.pdf" target="_blank">link.</a>

                          The project dealt with quantifying the spatial variables that make up for a livable neighborhood. Through this project,
                we wanted to see how the variables of livability such as Education Level or Rent Burden are correlated with each other spatially. We analyzed
                the census tracts in New York and New Jersey, and ran Global Moran's I and Anselin's Local Moran's I to analyze the correlation at global level (in this case, state level)
                and also at local level(census tracts) for the two states. The analysis was carried out on ArcGIS software and the data was collected from AMerican Community Survey(5-Year).

                          This is by far one of the most interesting projects I've worked on. As part of a CUSP Hackathon, we were asked to assess and analyse
        the chnages in green spaces across the city of Dublin. What was more exciting was the use of LIDAR data(courtesy Prof.Debra Laefer). Prof.Laefer has been working
        for quite some time on LIDAR data collection for Dublin city and her <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/02/explore-lidar-imaging-technology-dublin/" target="_blank">work</a> was recently published by NatGeo.
        Owing to the size of the dataset, we could only assess some portions of Dublin city and we were able to extract features that could show the difference
        between two datasets collected from different time periods. To see the cool images from LIDAR data, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/gauravcusp/LIDAR_DublinHackathon" target="_blank">Github Page.</a>

                                  <h3><em><b>Study how Heating Oil Based Boilers and Greenhouse Gases affect the air quality of NYC<</b></em><br></h3>
                          Every year as soon as the weather gets cold, we see a stream of black smoke arising from the buildings in New York
                                    and since many building still use age old oil fuels to heat their buildings, it would be a good idea to study the
                                    air quality in the winter months and see how these boiler emissions affect the environment. Coming up with a solution
                                    for this question is not easy as it depends on multiple factors such as the type of oil being used, what building type
                                    use these boilers (different laws apply for different building types), if the residents can afford the fuel prescribed by
                                    the government etc. For my analysis, I studied the factors that cause increase in Green House Gases (GHG) and
                                    how oil type contributes to it considering the socio-economic factors of the city. With some of the variables that deemed important
                                    based my research and previous studies, I chose 5 crucial variables that can help in prediction of GHG emissions in the city. Further,
                                    I considered some specific pollutants such as PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide and Sulphur dioxide that covers most part of pollution index of the city.

                            iListen is a web application that aims at deciphering user emotion based on their song preference and potentially help people
    through counseling who needs it. The reason why we are doing this is because, the fast paced lifestyle today has precipitated numerous negativities and sensitive emotions,
    new technologies have gradually distanced people apart. By building a communication and counseling platform via music, we can re-create a smaller world. The app essentially
    stores user prefernce for a trainig set of songs from Spotify and gives a score to each 'like' or 'dislike'. Based on user feedback, the scores for each song is re-weighted and
    a customized playlist is presented to the user. A spotify player is embedded on our page so the user can listen to the playlist on our webpage itself. Go ahead and check out

                            Buying a new house is always crucial as you need the best value for your money. For this, you consider a lot of varibales
                      before finalizing the houe you would want to purchase. These varibales could be internal to the house such as number of bedrooms, square footage etc.
                      as well as exteranl such as proximity to school and subway, safety of neighborhood etc. As one would assume, not all these variables are of
                      equal inportance to a person. In this project, I combined a few such variables to create a hedonic price model for New York City. In general, when we run
                      regression on our models, we fail to account for a very important feature, i.e. geography. To overcome this challenge, I used Geographically Weighted Regression(GWR)
                     to treat sptail component as a variable and Spatially Adjusted Regression that gives different weights to each varibale based on their geography. My model
                      explains 80% of the variance between the predicted and the expected values. For detailed analysis, you can access the report <a href="https://github.com/gauravcusp/Papers/blob/master/Project1_HedonicModel.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>

														<h3><em><b>Analyzing and Modeling Spatial Change – Space Time Geography</b></em><br></h3>
														The Space-Time geography project was particularly interesting as until now I've had exposure to only the space constrained
														movement data with no temporal effect. With this project, I was able to apply the third dimension of time to the movement data
														and was able to create a 3-D visualization of how a person moves in space and time. Some intersting use cases that I found were in the
														domain of traffic management, as during rush hours some of the streets are heavily crowded while others are comparatively vacant. With Space-Time
														data for a city, we can visualize and predict alternative routes during such peak hours. Project report can be found <a href="https://github.com/gauravcusp/Papers/blob/master/SpaceTimeAnalysis_AdvancedGISProject.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

																<h3><em><b>Classifying Land Use Pattern using Satellite Imagery</b></em><br></h3>
																The project was inspired by the Stanford's research on predicting poverty in Africa using night-time satellite imagery.
																In this project, we study the land use pattern of different cities and analyse the change in land use over the years. Since we
																	limited time, we focused on Houston,TX and studied the change in land use pattern over the years from 1993 to 2015 by using
																	the satellite images from the years 1993, 2003,2007, 2011 and 2015. We trained a random forest model to classify high density urban,
																low density urban, non-urban and water areas. The model was able to predict with good accuracy the high density and low density urban areas.

																<h3><em><b>Rent Burden Dashboard: A Data Visualization Project</b></em><br></h3>
												It's no news that everyone living in one of the metro cities across the world is paying hefty amounts of money
												to rent a housing unit. But in recent years, the situation has gone from bad to worse, since by 2014 nearly half of the US population
												was living under rent burden. We wanted to quantify and visualize the trends across the major cities of the US and therefore,
											we created a <a href="https://dorukkilitcioglu.shinyapps.io/RentBurden/" target="_blank">dashboard</a> using R-Shiny, that displays time series graphs for rent price, change in median rent price and a time lapse
											for 10 cities across US over the period of 8 years, 2009 to 2016.

                            Community support plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of prosecutorial justice sector and law enforcement. However, measuring public sentiments towards relevant policy implementations is difficult. Conventional methods are labor-intensive, time-lagged, and not scalable. Alternatively, we investigate the viability and strategies of leveraging social network services to assess public sentiments in a massive, timely, and effective manner. Focusing on Twitter, we first evaluate strategies to harvest relevant tweets and mitigate contamination. This includes keywords selection and streaming pipeline modification. Then, using the collected tweets regarding prosecutorial justice departments at both local and national levels, we assess whether a sentiment baseline exists based on the positive, neutral, or negative sentiments perceived by existing Natural Language Processing models. Finally, we investigate geographical and longitudinal variations in sentiments. The results show that measuring such sentiments is challenging. First, Twitter’s free Streaming API is not ideal qualitatively nor quantitatively for collecting the desired data. Second, the data is highly contaminated due to the inevitably ambiguous keywords. Finally, most tweets appear either neutral or slightly negative in the two models respectively. However, it is possible to observe and compare longitudinal trends and changes instead of absolute values. Recommendations for similar research pipeline are then concluded.
