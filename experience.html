													<h3><i>Geospatial Consultant, </i><b>World Bank Group</b><br></h3>
													As a consultant with SISRI team (Small Island States Resilience Initiative) under the Global Facility for Disaster
													Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) practice unit, I'm creating geospatial tools for the small island countries (SIDS).
													I'm responsible for devicing new ideas by leveraging Remote Sensing, GIS and Machine Learning and test their feasbility for
													SIDS and analyze the cost effectiveness of the tools. I create workflows and Python and JavaScript code to analyze <thead>
													satellite images from different sources and create flood, volcano eruption, landlslide and hurricane affected areas maps. <br> <br>

													I've been working with World Bank's City Resilience Program and designing scripts to automate the process of creating accessbility maps
													for the participating cities. The final mapping is done on ArcGIS Pro. The sample code for multiple analysis is uploaded on my
													<a href="https://github.com/gauravcusp/WB_CityResilienceProgram" target="_blank">github page.</a>

													 I'm also resonsible for creating a workflow for collection of open data for exposure and hazards to analyze the open data readiness for
													 these countries and give them a score on <a href="https://index.opendri.org/" target="_blank">OpenDRI Index</a>,
													an index prepared by the bank to assess the availability and ease of use of datasets that are considered to be key for disaster risk management.

													<h3><i>Data Science Intern, </i><b>Applied Data Corporation</b><br></h3>
													As my summer internship, I’m working with a Tampa,FL based firm Applied Data Corporation, that aims at reducing the fresh
													food waste by regulating supply chain and providing better technology to store managers to predict and keep track of
													their store items. I’m particularly working on transforming their application called  P-Cubed Production Manager,
													which is currently based on statistical algorithms. I’m responsible for creating a forecasting engine using machine
													learning techniques to make the predictions precise so as to further decrease the fresh food waste at their partner stores.
													Since most of their data is time dependent, I’ve working on creating time-series models using ARIMA and ARMA which are two
													of the most famous algorithms for time-series analysis. While the predictions were pretty good with these algorithms,
													I wanted to leverage deep learning to see if the predictions improve. I’m creating a model based on LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)
													which has proven to be pretty useful when it comes to dealing with large quantity time-series data.

													<h3><i>Graduate Summer Intern (Data Science), </i><b>New York Police Department</b><br></h3>
													I'm currently working with NYPD's Operations and Research Unit as Geo-Spatial Summer Intern.
													I'm responsible for analyzing different types of crime in space and time by leveraging 3-D capabilities
													of GIS systems. Since NYPD has been using ArcGIS Pro, I’ve been trained by ESRI professionals to use
													different tool sets of the software. I have experience of working with ArcMap, ArcScene and ArcGlobe
													from ArcGIS (they're now combined as part of ArcGIS Pro). Along with that I’m working on automating the mid-blocking tasks,
													a process of anonymizing the data, for the public release of datasets. Furthermore, I've automated their
													geocoding services and data manuipulation for large datasets that were done manually in MS Excel until now.

													<h3><i>Sports/Media/Tech Summer Startup Bootcamp Fellow, </i><b>Verizon</b><br></h3>
													WeR is a new startup, that I launched with a friend at NYU. Through this fellowship with NYC Media Labs and sponsorship from Verizon
													and Yahoo Sports, WeR is developing an app that would bridge the gap between the communication platforms
													 and the live video streaming capabilities of VR. Our intention with this app is to bring stadium like experience to your living room.
													 WeR was one of the 4 teams selected for this bootcamp, that essentially helps these startups to create a customer base and work on
													 narrowing down the value proposition of the product. At the end of the bootcamp, startups will pitch their ideas to sponsors,
													 venture capitalists and sports/media-tech firms for further funding.

	                      My interaction with Chief Data Officer of Los Angeles City, Sari Ladin, got me an internship with LAPD since I wanted to learn how police departments leverage big data
	                      and make data driven decisions. Having experience with backend data management, I'm creating a data pipeline for LAPD that takes
	                      data from their open data portal and pushes it to GeoHub, LA's geospatial hub for interactive maps. The process reuires workflow monitoring tools
	                      like Apache Airflow, Linux and Python scripts. Also, I created interactive maps through ArcGIS platform for the city of Los Angeles.

                          My 2017 winter break started with an internship with a start-up of a few NYU CUSP alumni.
                        At this internship, our end goal was to create a geo-crosswalk for LA county and New York City.
                        Over the period of 4 weeks, me and my other team members worked on from data collection to the deployment of API. We used the open datasets
                        from LA county and NYC open data websites and created an intersection of all the local geographies in the city, for instance census tract or police precinct.
                        This tabular data from Python was converted to a json for the API and also loaded to Postgres database for our website. We hosted our API on Heroku cloud service
                        using AWS Lambda and other Node.js scripts.

                          In December 2017, I received a fellowship from NYC Media Labs (mentored by Havas Media) to create a
                          rapid prototype for story-telling of Governors Island's history. My team mates and I created a chat-bot
                          for visitors that works as a wayfinding tool for the island, alongwith a guidebot who shares historical facts
                          and images from archives of NYC Public Library and Library of Congress. The bot assists user with any kind of
                          question thet may have and also learns from user interaction using machine learning techniques.

                    Straight out of school, I was hired by Infosys Limited, one of India's IT giants. During my initial days at Infosys, I was trained
                    in various programming languages such as Java and .Net(C#) along with SQL and HTML/CSS. I was further trained in testing domain for using
                    testing automation softwares like UFT, Selenium and Performance Center. I started my project with an Investment Management firm based out of LA,
                    the Captital Group of Companies. I was responsible for validating their internal application called Fixed Income Reporting, that generates financial
                    reports for portfolio managers based on the custom selection of assets/portfolios and the time period. My work here was quite data intensive and
                    that led me to explore more opportunities with data science.
